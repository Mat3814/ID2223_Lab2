Improving Pipeline Scalability and Model Performance
Task Description

This project fine-tunes the T5-small model for English-to-French translation using the opus_books dataset from the Helsinki NLP corpus. The objective is to enhance the pipeline's scalability and model performance using both model-centric and data-centric approaches.


1. Model-Centric Approach

The model-centric approach focuses on optimizing the training process and the architecture of the model itself. Below are several strategies employed or proposed to improve performance:

a. Hyperparameter Tuning

    Learning Rate Scheduling: Experiment with different learning rates and schedulers, such as cosine decay or a warm-up strategy, to stabilize training and improve convergence.
    
    Batch Size: Evaluate multiple batch sizes to balance memory usage and model performance. Larger batch sizes may help achieve better generalization when GPU resources are available.
    
    Epochs: Determine the optimal number of training epochs to avoid overfitting while ensuring sufficient learning.
    
    Optimizer Selection: Use AdamW with weight decay regularization for improved generalization.
    
    Gradient Accumulation: Utilize gradient accumulation to simulate large batch training without exceeding memory limits on smaller hardware.

b. Model Modifications

    Reduced Precision: Fine-tune the model with mixed-precision (fp16) training to increase computational efficiency while preserving performance.


c. Tokenization Adjustments

    Experiment with the tokenizer settings, such as max_length and padding, to ensure the model processes data efficiently without unnecessary truncation or padding.

2. Data-Centric Approach

The data-centric approach emphasizes improving the quality and quantity of the dataset to enhance model performance. Below are strategies explored or recommended:
a. Dataset Selection

    Opus Books Dataset: The dataset contains a diverse collection of literary text, making it suitable for translation tasks. Its quality is ensured through curated bilingual text pairs.

b. Data Augmentation

    Back-Translation: Use an existing French-to-English model to generate English translations of French text, creating synthetic data for fine-tuning.
    Paraphrasing: Generate paraphrases of English sentences using an English paraphrasing model to add diversity to training inputs.

c. Data Cleaning and Filtering

    Remove noisy or low-quality sentence pairs from the dataset that could mislead the model during training.
    Normalize text by standardizing casing, punctuation, and whitespace to reduce variability in the input data.

d. Explore Additional Data Sources

    Incorporate other high-quality parallel corpora, such as:
        Europarl: European Parliament proceedings.
        OpenSubtitles: Dialogue-based translations from movies and TV shows.
        UN Corpus: UN document translations for formal text.
    These additional datasets can help the model generalize across different domains and styles of translation.

Scalability and Inference Optimization

To ensure the fine-tuned model is scalable and optimized for CPU inference:

    Quantization: Apply post-training quantization (e.g., INT8) to reduce model size and improve inference speed on CPUs.
    Batch Inference: Process sentences in batches to maximize throughput while minimizing latency.
    Frameworks: Use frameworks like ONNX Runtime or TensorRT for further inference optimization
